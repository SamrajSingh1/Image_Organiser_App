# Image_Organiser_App

Kindly watch video saved in directory to understand the working of Appllication.

This app will get location of perticular folder from user ,user will browse to that folder after that app will automatically organize the images of that folder and classify all images into 3 subfolder called Document image , Family photo and Nature image. App will distinguish between images through machine learning algorithm running on server.


Integration of Android App and python model through REST APIs(Created using Flask Framework in Python).
Aim was to make an Android Application Using Python Model which can differentiate between Document image
Nature Images and Family photo so that user can delete unnecessary Images and free up space in device.
Using Machine Learning Algorithms and tesseract python library for OCR to identify document image.

I have learned lot from this project about Machine learning ,REST APIs ,Server and Android App Development.
